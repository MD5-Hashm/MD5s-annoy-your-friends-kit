# MD5s-annoy-your-friends-kit
A bunch of shittily coded scripts to automate annoying my friends at one point or another.

Keep in mind that shittily coded or not I wrote all these programs myself and if you decide to include these files in a Youtube or Reddit post for example please include some form of credit

I may (probably wont) make updates to these programs and even less likely publish these changes to github but all these scripts work on windows 10 and should work on other os

If you want to annoy your friends by winning a coin toss every time type Flip (Capital) for tails and flip (Lowcase) for heads 
Lets spam david scripts are pretty self explainistory enter the message (And delay if applicable) then click on the chat box you would like to spam
And for aptly named "yolo penis.py" open the program, switch to the yolo tab with the question  you want to spam fairly quickly hover your mouse over the send button for a few seconds and switch back then enter the shown cords into the input box and your message, switch back to the tab and you should be good to go

As for the requirments I have included the imports at the very top of the file so just install the requrments you dont have fron the tops of each file
